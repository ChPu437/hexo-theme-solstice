**NOTICE:** This theme is made mainly for my blog, **so no feature that I won't use will be added, and some of the feature will be changing greatly**, if you wish to use this theme or make some modification, I suggest you to fork it before going on.

[Demo (Actually my blog XD)](https://blog.chpu437.com/)

A hexo theme written for my blog.

It's currently under development, and many of the options need some modification to use the theme on other blogs.

I'll modificate it for general use and add an instruction someday later.
